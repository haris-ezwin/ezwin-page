Hey parents and students! 👋

Haris here. I just wanted to share some updates including improving our worksheets. I believe that with these changes, it can help your child or you as a student to improve your grades.

So let's get started on the first one: Upgraded Worksheets

---

## 🚀 Weekly Personalised Targeted Learning

Every week, your child will now go through a **"Level Up Section"** — a short, focused section in the worksheet that is made up of questions they previously got wrong. These may be the **exact same questions** or **similar variations** to get better in  the concepts they need more help in.

✅ This means:
- Students **revisit their mistakes weekly**
- Learning is **personalised and targeted**

---

## 🧐 Double Check Your Answers

One thing I noticed a lot is that the students that we teach generally don't double check their work before submitting their worksheets. Therefore, we’ve created a new feature called: **Double-Check feature**.  

So, before submitting a worksheet, students will be asked to **review each answer for 20 seconds**.

🕒 Why this matters:
- Builds the habit of **self-checking**
- Helps students **catch careless mistakes**
- Encourages **exam-ready discipline**

Each question even has a **visual indicator** to show it’s been reviewed.  

_A small change that can make a big difference in exam marks!_

## 🧠 Smaller Worksheets, Less Stress

To make learning feel more manageable, we're now **breaking large worksheets into bite-sized worksheets**.  

This helps students:
- Stay **focused**
- Feel a **sense of achievement**
- Learn in **short, effective bursts**

## 🌱 Let’s Keep Growing Together

Once again, thank you all, both parents and students, who are part of the **EzWin Academy** community.  
These changes are just the beginning. We're committed to helping every student:

- Feel **excited about learning** 📚  
- Build **confidence through practice** 💪  

We look forward to supporting your child every step of the way.  
Let’s keep levelling up — **together!**
