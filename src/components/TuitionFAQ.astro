    question: "What happens during the classes?",
    answer: [
      "Every session is live on Zoom with a small group of students. We start with an engaging Kahoot lesson to make learning interactive and fun.",
      "After that, each student receives a personalised worksheet (we call them Level Up Worksheets 🚀) tailored to their specific weaknesses. This gives them focused practice on the areas where they need the most improvement.",
      "Once students have completed their work, we go through the questions together as a group so everyone can understand the solutions and learn from each other.",

  },
  {
    question: "Who is this for?",
    answer: [
      "Parents with Primary 5 to 6 children who are invested in their child's progress and can provide supervision during online classes. We've found that students with a parent or sibling nearby are more focused and engaged.",
      "If you expect to leave your child alone online, we'd recommend physical tuition instead. Our approach works best when there's someone nearby to keep them accountable.",
    ],
  },
  {
    question: "How much does the tuition cost?",
    answer: [
      "Tuition is $200 per month after your free trial ends.",
      "We only request payment details once you confirm you want to continue.",
      "When you stay on, we charge your card each month and you can cancel anytime before the next billing cycle.",
